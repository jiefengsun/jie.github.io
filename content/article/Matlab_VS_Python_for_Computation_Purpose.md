## Basic Decision

First, I believe that both of them are great and can finally work out. The only thing I need to consider is which one can save me efforts and be useful in my future career. Of course, I can be proficient on both languages, but using a language is not a purpose but a way to my results. Currently, I am targeting to be a professor in the future and I will be teaching and doing research using these languages. Before becoming a professor, I will have to do specific research using these languages for at least 4 years since now(2020).  

This will be a sharp tool for me to finish my current work. 

Matlab is already sharp enough, I feel the reason why Ben switch to Python is that he likes the Objective Oriented programming in python when he uses the Machine Learning packages. The main issue is that some algorithms in Python packages are not verified and the documentation is not good at all and as a student, Matlab documentation is really as good as a textbook and all of them are written by professionals. 

So for me, I still believe that Matlab is a more sharppend tool at least for now.

## How to compensate the insufficiency 

One of the main issue for Matlab is that it is not very convenient to use Objective Oriented programming (defining classes). Of course, it is very convenient to write a big program using Python. The convenience is shown in passing varialbes and the clear structure of the program. Matlab can only use the global paramters and packed state variables in a nested funciton to pass paramters and variables. However, this might be already be enough for me to implement my TCA model. 

## Difference

Ben is trying to make the model to be comprehensive or general enough. However, research processes always lead us to a situation that we have to deal with `new` and `specific` work. If it is included in a previous general method, then it will not be research any more. We have to know that we are not going to build a software or a produce, instead we need to verify that our idea works.

## What to do next. 

I don't really have to turn all previous codes to Matlab. But for the new programming: first spatial discretize and then march in time, I might just program in Matlab. 
Theoretical speaking, the previous implicit method should also work. 

## The main problems

1 The spatial integration does not have enough accuracy. Quoternion need to be used to allow for easy implementing any existing ODE solving packages: may be ODE45.  

2 The 

## Plans I still should first try to modify and then contrive my own more improved ones. 

#### Ignore the **accuracy and speed** problem, just first make it work, and then improve.

1 Modify the current static one's reference state to make the static to work.

2 Modify the dynamic one to make it work

3 Start to summarize the current status
