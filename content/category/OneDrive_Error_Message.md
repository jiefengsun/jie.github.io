I use OneDrive for Business. The error happens when I changed the directory/folder that I want to synchronize. 

The problem is the name of your folder is wrong and the best way is to just let OneDrive degenerate the folders and you move the files that you want to synchronize into tht folder. 

To solve the problem follow the following steps:


0. Try to reinstall OneDrive and reset OneDrive using cmd commend: `%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset`
1. Name a folder _OneDrive_ exactly.
2. Select the folder as the folder that you will synchronize.
3. OneDrive will create a folder named _OneDrive - ***_, where *** is your Business domain.
4. Move all you file to the folder _OneDrive - ***_.
