My name is Jiefeng Sun (孙杰锋), a PhD student at [Colorado State University in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/) since Aug, 2017 under the supervision of [Prof. Zhao](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/dr-jianguo-zhao/). My research focuses on design, modeling and control of soft robots and artificial muscles (high-energy-density small actuators). I was born in Xuchang, Henan, China and earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering respectively from Lanzhou University of Technology Lanzhou in 2014 and [Dalian University of Technology (DLUT)](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2017.

#### [Research Areas:](https://jiefengsun.github.io/pages/research.html)

- Use artificial muslces (soft actuators) to actuate soft robots to achieve programmed motion.
- Implement rod models on modeling soft robots and artificial muslce
#### Awards
Scott Inaugural Graduate Fellowship, 2017

Finalist for the best student paper in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS,2018)
